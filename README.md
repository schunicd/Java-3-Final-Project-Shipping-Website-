There are two purposes to my project, the first would be to allow a sales person to enter a customerâ€™s order based off of 
available inventory. The sales person also has the ability to print an excel document which details all vital information 
for each customers sales order, item descriptions, weights, prices and ship dates can be found on this document to provide 
the customer with a better understanding of the entire breakdown of their order. The sales person also has the ability to 
edit/delete items on an order as needed. 

The second purpose of my project is to allow someone from the shipping/receiving department to print off shipping manifests 
as needed and allow customization of the manifests based off the weight of the truck being loaded. The shipping/receiving 
department also has the ability to update the inventory with new items and refresh stock as items are received. If an item 
is discontinued, or is no longer being sold, the shipping/receiving department is able to remove the item from the systems 
inventory. My program also creates an encrypted version of the shipping manifest to keep for archiving purposes. Security 
is an issue for any company, and information such as their shipment schedules needs to be protected. My program also deletes 
any un-encrypted shipping manifests when the user of the shipping department logs out, as a method of protecting this shipment 
information. It is possible to modify this based off of what a company using my application would like, such as deleting 
manifests that are more than 7 days old.
